# Object-Detection-Using-Python-OpenCV-and-YOLO-V5
In this lesson we will learn YOLO Object Detection Using OpenCV And Python Complete Project

In this project we are building real time object detection where we will detect the object in real time. In this course course we trained 20 different object those are 'person', 'car', 'chair', 'bottle', 'pottedplant', 'bird', 'dog', 'sofa', 'bicycle', 'horse', 'boat', 'motorbike', 'cat', 'tvmonitor', 'cow', 'sheep', 'aeroplane', 'train', 'diningtable' and 'bus'.

In order to achieve this we will follow the Data Science SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). First we will start by gathering the data and requirements.  After that based on the requirements we will create the pipeline to prepare the data.

Once our data is ready then we will train our YOLOv5 model in Google Collab GPU environment. Finally we will extract the detection from the model.

Steps for Implementation:

1. Installing OpenCV and other required libraries
2. Preparing the dataset and annotations for training
3. Training the YOLO model using Darknet
4. Fine-tuning the pre-trained YOLO model for better accuracy
5. Testing the trained model on images and videos
6. Visualizing the results and tuning the parameters for better performance
